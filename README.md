# 🎮 NetBooking

**A Food & Beverage Ordering System for Gaming Cafes**

This is my pet project to order foods and drinks in Gaming Cyber (Internet Cafe). NetBooking aims to streamline the ordering process for gamers who want to enjoy food and beverages without interrupting their gaming sessions.

## 📖 Project Overview

NetBooking is designed to solve the common problem faced in gaming cafes where customers want to order food and drinks but don't want to leave their gaming stations. This system will allow gamers to place orders directly from their stations and have items delivered to them.

## ✨ Features (Planned)

- 🍕 **Digital Menu**: Browse available food and beverages
- 🛒 **Easy Ordering**: Simple and intuitive ordering interface
- 💺 **Station-based Delivery**: Orders delivered directly to gaming stations
- 💳 **Multiple Payment Options**: Support for various payment methods
- 📊 **Order Tracking**: Real-time order status updates
- 👥 **User Management**: Customer accounts and order history
- 🏪 **Admin Panel**: Menu management and order processing for cafe staff
